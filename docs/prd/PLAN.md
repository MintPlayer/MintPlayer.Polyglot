# MintPlayer.Polyglot — Milestone Plan

Companion to [POLYGLOT_PRD.md](POLYGLOT_PRD.md). Each milestone names a concrete deliverable and a **gate**
(the observable thing that says it's done). This is a long-haul craft project — milestones are ordered but
unhurried, and the §3 support/refuse contract in the PRD is the law every milestone is checked against.

---

## P0 — Solution skeleton ✅ done (built green 2026-06-28)
The Visual Studio solution and sources are committed: `MintPlayer.Polyglot.Core` (static lib),
`MintPlayer.Polyglot.Cli` (the `polyglot` exe answering `--version`/`--help`, `build` stubbed), and
`MintPlayer.Polyglot.Tests` (a tiny zero-dependency assert harness). C++20, x64 Debug/Release.
*Gate (closed):* the hand-authored `.sln`/`.vcxproj` build with **0 warnings / 0 errors** via the
VS 18 "Insiders" MSBuild. The projects target toolset **v145** (→ MSVC 14.51), so they require VS 2026 —
a deliberate VS-2026-only pin (see CLAUDE.md for paths). `MintPlayer.Polyglot.Cli.exe --version` prints
`0.0.1`; `...Tests.exe` reports all-pass.

## P1 — Language design v0.1 ✅ locked (2026-06-28)
Design the source language on paper before any compiler code. Write a grammar (EBNF) + a short language
spec + 5–10 sample `.pg` programs spanning the §3.A supported surface (a function, a struct/record, an
enum + pattern match, a generic, an iterator, exception handling, a `using`). Deliberately exclude the
§3.B refused features from the grammar entirely.
*Delivered:* `docs/lang/grammar.ebnf` (admits only §3.A; §3.B unspeakable), `docs/lang/SPEC.md` (spec with
per-feature C#/TS lowering tables + the §3.C relaxation list + §3.B refusals), and `docs/lang/samples/` —
9 focused samples (`01_functions` … `09_strings`) covering every §3.A feature + `fruitcake_sketch.pg`,
the surface test modeled 1:1 on `MintPlayer.AI`'s `FruitCakeWorld.cs`. Key design call: only `class`
(mutable, reference identity) and `record` (immutable, structural equality) — **mutable value types
(`struct`) are refused for v0.1** because they are the one construct whose value/reference identity
diverges between C# and TS (SPEC §4.2).
*Gate (closed):* samples reviewed across the design sessions; v0.1 locked and used as the basis for the
P2 MVP. (Semicolons clarified as an optional separator during P2 — grammar/SPEC updated to match.)

## P2 — Walking skeleton (MVP) ✅ done (2026-06-28) ★ thinnest end-to-end slice
Took a *minimal* language subset — `fn`, `i32`/`f64` + arithmetic, `let`/`var`, `if`/`while`, function
calls, `print` — **all the way through** the pipeline: lexer → recursive-descent parser → typer (name
resolution + types, annotated tree = the typed IR) → **hand-written C# *and* TS pretty-printers** (no
Roslyn/ts-morph — §4.3). `polyglot build foo.pg` emits `foo.cs` + `foo.ts`. This front-loaded the
project's biggest architectural bet — that **one high-level IR serves both targets** — and stood up the
crown-jewel **differential conformance test** at P2 instead of P5. Later milestones *widen* each pass.
*Delivered:* `src/MintPlayer.Polyglot.Core` (diagnostics/token/ast/lexer/parser/sema/emit_csharp/
emit_typescript/compiler); `polyglot build` in the CLI; 20 in-process unit/golden tests; and
`tests/conformance/` (`run-diff.ps1` + `programs/arithmetic.pg`).
*Gate (closed):* `arithmetic.pg` → emitted C# compiles+runs under `dotnet` and TS runs under `node`
(type-stripping), with **identical stdout** (`128 / 28 / 50`); `run-diff.ps1` is green. Semicolons are an
optional separator (statements are newline-terminated) — grammar/SPEC aligned to the samples.

## P3 — Full front-end (lexer + parser) ✅ done (2026-06-29)
Widened the MVP front-end to the entire P1 grammar: full token set + a recursive-descent parser over the
whole surface — expressions (member/index/call, `?.`/`??`/`!`, ranges, lambdas, list/tuple/`with`, if-expr,
`match` + patterns), the `TypeRef` type grammar (named/generic/tuple/function/nullable), all statements
(`for`/`while`/`do`-less, `try`/`catch`/`when`/`finally`, `throw`, `use`, `yield`, break/continue,
compound/lvalue assignment), declarations (`fn`/`record`/`class`/`interface`/`extension`/`enum`/`union`,
members, generic params/bounds, default params), and `import`. A canonical `.pg` pretty-printer
(`pg_printer`, exposed as `polyglot fmt`) is the fidelity surface.
*Gate (closed):* all 10 `docs/lang/samples/*.pg` (incl. `fruitcake_sketch`) round-trip source → AST →
source idempotently — `tests/fidelity/run-roundtrip.ps1`, wired into `/build-and-test`. Malformed input
yields `file:line:col` diagnostics. Built incrementally (P3 1 → 3e-3), green at every step.
String interpolation is fully parsed (chunks + hole expressions, re-entrant lexer). *Deferred (small, not
the gate):* the `{ get/set }` property-accessor form (samples use read-only `=> expr` properties only),
nested strings inside an interpolation hole, and nested-generic edge cases beyond the samples. The
trivia-bearing lexer keeps comments/whitespace for *later* readable output; the P3 printer is canonical
(re-formats), not trivia-preserving.

## P4 — Full semantics + typed IR ✅ done (2026-06-29)
Built the static type system + the **separate typed IR** (per the design decision to make the IR its own
tree, not just the typed AST): name/type resolution across the whole declaration surface (unknown-type,
duplicate, missing-member, wrong-arity diagnostics); nominal expression typing (members, construction,
method calls, operator-overload lookup, `this`/`super`, `EnumName.Case`, nullability) — lenient on
unknown/generic/std types so there are no false positives; pattern-match exhaustiveness (union/enum/bool +
catch-all required for non-enumerable scalars); a dedicated IR (`ir.hpp`: typed tagged hierarchy carrying
resolved decisions — the `print` intrinsic, the `main` entry) produced by a lowering pass (`lower.hpp`,
AST→IR after sema); and the **backends rerouted to emit from the IR**, so the pipeline is now
lexer→parser→sema→lower→IR→backend (PRD §4.1/§4.2).
*Gate (closed):* type errors reported with `file:line:col`; a deterministic **typed IR dump** (`<expr>:<type>`)
verified by unit tests; resolution/typing/exhaustiveness covered by ~25 sema/IR unit tests. Conformance
unchanged (arithmetic.pg → IR → identical C#/TS).
*Notes:* full semantic checking runs on self-contained programs; the std-using P1 samples get end-to-end
type-checking at P7 (when `List`/`Error`/`sqrt`/… exist). The IR/lowering cover the MVP subset today and
widen to the full §3.A surface in P5. Expr nodes now carry a resolved `TypeRef`. Generic *instantiation*
substitution and full overload *mangling* are best-effort/lenient for now (refined as P5/P6 need them).

## P5 — Backends to the full §3.A surface
Widen both hand-written pretty-printers from the MVP subset to the **entire supported surface**: records,
enums, unions + pattern matching, iterators, exceptions, `using`/disposal, extension methods, operators,
properties/indexers, closures — idiomatic in each target. Golden-output baselines checked in for **both**
targets; the differential conformance suite (stood up at P2) grows to cover the surface.
Also introduce the **backend-interface seam**: a small `Backend` abstraction (`name()` + `emit(unit)`)
selected via a registry, replacing the `if/else` on `Target` in `compile()`. Backends stay compiled-in,
but this is the shape the P9 declarative-plugin API grows from — the natural moment, with two *complete*
native backends to generalize across (the design note's "extracted, not guessed").
*Gate:* P1 samples emit C# that compiles under `dotnet build` and TS that type-checks under `tsc` + runs
under Node, both with expected output; golden baselines green; the differential suite passes.
*Progress (in flight, 2026-06-29):* the **backend-interface seam** is in (a `Backend` abstraction +
registry; `compile()` selects via `findBackend`). The IR/lowering/both backends now cover **records**
(fields, methods, operators, properties), **enums**, **unions + pattern matching** (exhaustiveness, ctor
patterns/binders), **operators & properties** (C# `operator +` / expr-bodied property vs TS `.plus()` /
getter), **classes** (mutable reference types with `init`, **inheritance + `super(...)`**), **`for…in`**
over ranges and iterables, **iterators (`yield`** → C# `IEnumerable`+`yield return` / TS `function*`),
**exceptions** (`throw` + `try`/`catch`/`when`/`finally`; TS gets an `instanceof`/guard dispatch chain),
and **`use`/disposal** (→ `try/finally` + `.dispose()`). `Iterable` and `Error` are registered as core
builtin types. The differential suite grew from 1 → 11 self-contained programs (arithmetic, records,
vec2, enums, unions, counter, forrange, iterator, exceptions, inheritance, disposal), all agreeing.
*Lambda syntax* now also admits the bare single-parameter form `x => …` (grammar/SPEC/PRD updated);
parsing + canonical formatting done, codegen pending (see closures below).
*Remaining:* **closures/lambdas** (parsed + type-checked + formatted; IR lowering + arrow-fn emission
still to do); **extension methods**; **generic emission** (type params + instantiation).

## P6 — Faithfulness pass
Implement the §3.C relaxations *as documented behaviour*: int32/uint masking (`|0`/`>>>0`/`Math.imul`),
opt-in `Math.fround` strict floats, `BigInt` for int64, structural equality/hashing, null/undefined
normalization. Enforce the §3.B **refusals** with clear, actionable compiler errors (not miscompiles).
*Gate:* a numeric conformance suite passes within tolerance across both targets; every refused feature has
a refusal test asserting the diagnostic; the relaxation list is written up in the spec.

## P7 — Std core + expect/actual + FFI (the three plugin mechanisms, as first-party code)
A minimal portable standard library in `.pg` (math, basic collections, iterators) compiled to both
targets. The **target-gated `expect`/`actual`** mechanism (portable core forbidden from touching platform
APIs; per-target `actual` impls) and an `extern`/inline-target **FFI hatch**. This is where the three
mechanisms of the plugin architecture — *binding*, *replacement*, *capability* — are proven **as
first-party code** behind a backend interface designed to become the plugin API (see the plugin design
note, below).
*Gate:* a program using a portable std API + one `expect`/`actual` capability (e.g. current time) builds
and runs identically on both targets; the portable core cannot reference `document`/`System.*` (compiler-
enforced, with a test proving the rejection).

## P8 — Dogfood: the FruitCake physics ★ north star
Express the MintPlayer.AI FruitCake circle-physics solver in `.pg`. Generate `FruitCakeWorld`-equivalent
C# and `fruit-cake-physics`-equivalent TS. Wire the **differential conformance test** against the existing
hand-ported twins (same seed + scripted drops → settled board within tolerance + identical merge counts;
per §3.D, tolerance/behavioural, not bit-exact).
*Gate:* generated C# and generated TS each match their hand-ported counterpart's behaviour on the
conformance suite. At this point Polyglot has *earned* the right to own that physics; the hand-ports can
retire while the conformance test stays (now guarding the generator).

## P9 — Declarative backend engine + DSL
The backends, generalized. *Extract* a declarative backend format from the two **native** C#/TS backends
(P4/P5) — a rule/template per IR node (context-aware: precedence, expr-vs-stmt position), the std-type
mapping, operator/keyword tables, naming/import rules, and the build-project scaffold. Build the core's
**declarative emit engine** that interprets a spec, and **re-express C# and TS as declarative specs**.
Critically, the DSL is extracted from working backends, never guessed (the §4.3 "design it twice"
discipline applied to the format itself); a **local full-power plugin tier** covers what the DSL can't yet
express. See **[`../design/plugins-and-targets.md`](../design/plugins-and-targets.md)** §4/§7.
*Gate:* C#/TS emitted via the declarative specs match the native backends' golden output byte-for-byte.

## P10 — Plugin distribution + ecosystem (the endpoint of §4.4)
The downloadable, declarative plugin system: a **workspace config (`pgconfig.json`)** declaring target
*environments* (desktop/web/mobile/…) + plugins+versions; **download → shared cache → verify → lockfile**
(declarative data only — no executable code fetched; integrity-pinned, zip-slip-safe); **availability
resolution** by target + environment (off-target use is a compile error, never a miscompile); and
**build-dependency threading** (a plugin declares the NuGet `PackageReference`s/SDK or npm deps its output
needs; the core emits a buildable project including them). Trust model + open decisions in the design note.
*Gate:* adding a **downloaded declarative Python backend** *and* a target-scoped binding plugin (e.g.
WinForms, with its PackageReferences) requires **no core change** — only `pgconfig.json` + downloads; a program
using them emits a buildable project, and wrong-target/-environment use is rejected with a clear diagnostic.

## Stretch (unordered, post-P10)
- **Further targets** as downloadable declarative backends (the IR is target-neutral by design).
- **Source maps:** thread positions through every pass for debuggable JS output; decide the C# debug story.
- **LSP:** build the frontend as a reusable library; make the CLI and a future language server thin clients.
- **Binding auto-generation:** shape-only bindings from `.d.ts` / .NET metadata / WebIDL + hand overrides
  (feeds the plugin ecosystem; produces declarative data at authoring time).
- **Plugin registry & signing:** distribution/versioning infrastructure + signature trust for downloads.
