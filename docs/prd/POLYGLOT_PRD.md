# MintPlayer.Polyglot — Cross-SDK Transpiler (PRD & Plan)

> Write logic **once** in a small, purpose-built source language; emit **idiomatic, readable** code for
> multiple target SDKs — **C#/.NET** and **TypeScript/JS** first. Polyglot is deliberately *not* a
> general-purpose "any language → any language" compiler (a multi-decade trap); it is **faithful-by-
> default with a published relaxation list**, and it **refuses** the features that sink transpilers.

- **Status:** Draft v1.0 · 2026-06-29 · P0 built; P1 locked; P2 MVP; P3 (full grammar + round-trip);
  **P4 done** — semantics + a separate typed IR; pipeline is lexer→parser→sema→lower→IR→backend. Next: P5
  (widen IR/lowering/backends to the full §3.A surface).
- **Author:** Pieterjan (with Claude Code).
- **Provenance:** distilled from a four-agent investigation into multi-target transpilers (Haxe, Kotlin
  Multiplatform, Fable, Scala.js, TypeScript, J2CL/GWT, JSIL, Bridge.NET). The investigation's
  "what to support / what to refuse / how others die" findings *are* this document's spec (see §9 Sources).
- **Motivating dogfood:** the MintPlayer.AI **FruitCake physics solver**, hand-maintained today as a C#
  twin and a TS twin. Generating both from one Polyglot source — with a differential conformance test
  proving they agree — is the v1.0 north star (§6 P8). The twins live in the **sibling repo**
  `C:\Repos\MintPlayer.AI`: C# at `src/MintPlayer.AI.ReinforcementLearning.Environments/FruitCake/FruitCakeWorld.cs`,
  TS at `src/RLDemo.Web/ClientApp/src/app/fruit-cake/fruit-cake-physics.ts` (the two files declare each
  other canonical mirrors). "M30" referenced below is that repo's milestone for shipping the hand-ported
  client-side physics + conformance test (see its `docs/prd/FRUITCAKE_CLIENT_AI_PRD.md`).

---

## 1. Vision & the problem it solves

Cross-platform projects routinely need the *same logic* in more than one language: a physics solver in
C# (for native/training) **and** TypeScript (for the browser); validation rules on a .NET backend **and**
an Angular frontend; a state machine in both. Hand-porting works but rots — the two copies drift, and
parity becomes a manual, error-prone chore.

The investigation's blunt lesson: a **general** transpiler that supports "as many features and platform
APIs as possible" is a person-decade effort that only survives with a corporate sponsor or a founder's
life-long stewardship, because it drowns in (a) the runtime-pushed language features and (b) the
unbounded standard-library/platform-API surface. **Polyglot wins by refusing that scope.** It targets
the *portable-logic* sweet spot — pure computation, data, and control flow that is identical everywhere —
and explicitly hands platform APIs back to the target via thin bindings.

The decision rule we build around: **the more the shared surface is structure/logic, the better a
transpiler fits; the more it is platform glue, the less.** Polyglot owns the first half.

---

## 2. Goals & Non-Goals

### Goals
- **One source language → idiomatic, readable C# *and* TypeScript** for the supported feature set.
- **Faithful-by-default semantics with a documented relaxation list** (the Scala.js model) — never silent
  surprises.
- **A self-contained native toolchain** (single `polyglot` CLI, zero runtime dependency) — fitting the
  from-scratch ethos of the surrounding repos.
- **Differential conformance built in**: the same source → both targets → a generated test asserting they
  produce identical results. Parity is a *test artifact*, not a hope.
- **Dogfood the FruitCake physics** as the first real program, retiring its hand-ported twin.

### Non-Goals
- A general "any-language-in, any-language-out" compiler.
- Broad platform-API coverage (all of the DOM *and* all of the .NET BCL) — incoherent by deployment
  target; handled instead by **target-gated bindings** (§4.4).
- The 🔴 runtime-heavy features (see §3.B): threads/locks, runtime reflection, finalizers/GC-timing,
  `decimal`, `unsafe`/pointers, `dynamic`/runtime code-gen, **bit-exact cross-target floats**.
- Beating Haxe/Kotlin/Fable at their game. If "many mature targets" is ever the goal, adopt one of those.
  Polyglot is a focused, owned tool for *this* author's portable-logic needs (and a long-loved craft).

## 3. Language-feature spec (the support/refuse contract)

Derived directly from the investigation's per-feature analysis. **This is the scope contract** — the
single most important thing to hold the line on, because every dead transpiler died by not holding it.

### A. Supported — lowers cleanly to **both** C# and JS (the 🟢 core)
*(This is the maximal surface, calibrated to the first two targets. With more targets the usable surface
is the per-project intersection of backend capabilities — see §3.E.)*
Operators (overloading → static calls), properties/indexers (→ get/set / `get_Item`), extension methods
(→ static calls), exceptions (`try/catch/finally`, typed catch → `instanceof` dispatch + rethrow, `when`
→ guard), `using`/disposal (→ `try/finally`), iterators/`yield` (→ `function*` / `IEnumerable`),
pattern matching / discriminated unions (→ tagged objects + switch, compile-time exhaustiveness), enums,
closures / lambdas (`x => …` or `(a, b) => …`, both → native arrow functions; capture-by-ref agrees on
both sides), function overloading (→ compile-time name-mangling; C# keeps the source name, TS mangles by
parameter type), **numeric conversions via explicit casts `(T)x`** (not a `toI64()`/`toU32()` method swamp)
with **implicit lossless widening** (a narrower value flows into a wider slot automatically — assignment,
argument, return, mixed-width arithmetic; narrowing, lossy `i64→f64`, and sign changes require the cast —
see SPEC §3), strings/char (**both targets are UTF-16** — near 1:1, with surrogate-pair care).

### B. Refused — out loud, with clear compiler diagnostics (the 🔴 list)
Threads / `lock` / `Interlocked` / `Parallel.*` (single-threaded async only); runtime reflection /
`Activator` / open-world `Type.GetType(string)` (compile-time metadata only — reflection defeats tree-
shaking and is the #1 bloat source); finalizers / non-deterministic GC hooks (keep `using`, drop `~T()`);
`decimal` (unless a big-decimal lib is later opted in); `unsafe` / pointers / `stackalloc` / raw `Span`;
`dynamic` / `Reflection.Emit` / `Expression.Compile`; **LINQ expression trees** (`Expression<Func<…>>` —
code-as-inspectable-data has no portable JS counterpart; a lambda is *always* an executable closure, never
a queryable tree); **bit-exact cross-target floating point** (see §3.D).

### C. Faithful-by-default, with a *published relaxation list* (the 🟡 corners)
- **int32 / uint / sub-32 overflow:** mask at operation boundaries (`|0`, `>>>0`, `Math.imul`) so JS
  wraps like .NET. Documented relaxation: intermediate overflow below 2⁵³ that .NET would wrap is *not*
  caught unless an explicit `Int32` type is used (the Fable/Haxe leak — made explicit, not silent).
- **int64 / long:** emit JS `BigInt` (ES2020) — correct, at a perf cost; the alternative two-word `Long`
  class is a later option if BigInt proves too slow.
- **float (32-bit) vs double:** default lets `float` ride a JS `double`; `Math.fround`-per-op strictness is
  **opt-in** (the Scala.js strict-floats tax) for code that needs single-precision rounding parity.
- **nullability:** normalize `null`/`undefined`; pick one and stick to it. **Nullable generics use a real
  `Option<T>` (✅ done 2026-06-30 — see PLAN P14c):** `T?` over an *unconstrained* type
  parameter has no faithful native emission — C# `null` is CS0403, `T?`+`default(T)` returns `0` for value
  types (silent divergence from TS `null`), and `Nullable<T>` is value-types-only (CS0453). So `T?` whose
  base is a bare generic parameter **desugars to a real `Option<T>` generic union** (`Some(x)`/`None`),
  emitted via the existing union machinery (tagged on both targets — distinguishes `Some(null)` from `None`).
  Concrete/reference `T?` keeps the idiomatic native nullable (C# `int?`/ref, TS `T | null`).
- **equality / hashing:** generate structural `Equals`/`GetHashCode`; identity hash via a side `WeakMap`.

### D. The determinism honesty clause
Bit-exact cross-runtime IEEE-754 is **not a promise Polyglot makes.** Only `+ − × ÷ √` are correctly-
rounded and reproducible (and only at matched width); **transcendentals** (`sin`/`cos`/`exp`/`pow`),
FMA contraction, and JIT reassociation diverge between the .NET JIT and a JS engine. Code that needs
identical results across targets must use the std's **fixed-point / soft-float** numeric type (a planned
std module), *not* `float`/`double`. (The FruitCake solver uses only `+ − × ÷ √`, so its differential
test gates on **tolerance + behavioural equality**, never bit-equality — see the M30 plan in MintPlayer.AI.)

### E. Per-target capability negotiation (the multi-target generalization)
§3.A is written against C# and TS, which both happen to support the **entire** supported surface. That
two-target coincidence hides a question every *additional* target raises: not every SDK can express every
§3.A feature with an idiomatic, call-site-preserving mapping. Concretely (from the cross-SDK survey):
**extension methods** keep `x.method()` on C#, Kotlin, Swift, Dart, Rust (extension-trait + `use`), Ruby,
but **cannot** on Java, Go, C++, PHP — there is no language mechanism to attach instance-call syntax to a
type you don't own; the only faithful emission is a free function `method(x)`, which *changes the call
site*. Several targets also lack operator overloading, properties, etc.

**Decision — capabilities are declared, intersected, and gated at compile time:**
- Each **backend declares a finite, named set of capability flags** — one per §3.A feature
  (`extensionMethods`, `operatorOverloading`, `properties`, `iterators`, `patternMatching`, …). This is the
  §3.A list turned machine-checkable; the set is **closed** (resist growing it per feature request — that
  is the scope-creep failure mode).
- The **usable surface for a project is the *intersection*** of the declared capabilities across **all**
  targets configured in `pgconfig.json`. Using a feature outside the intersection is a **compile-time
  refusal that names the capability and the lacking target(s)** — never a silent miscompile and never a
  silent per-target call-site change.
- **Two refusal classes, kept distinct.** §3.B is a **global** hard-refusal (no faithful emission *anywhere*
  — target-independent). §3.E capability-gating is **target-set-dependent** (the feature is fine on some
  targets, withheld only when a configured target lacks it). The diagnostics must read differently:
  "Polyglot refuses X" (§3.B) vs "target *T* does not support X; remove it or drop *T*" (§3.E).
- **For C#/TS today the intersection is the full §3.A surface, so nothing is gated yet.** The mechanism is
  nonetheless **already implemented and active** (P5): each `compile()` walks the program for used features
  and refuses any the target can't emit — it simply never fires while both backends declare the full set.
  This means the gate is in place *before* a target that can't do a feature ever ships (no retrofit — the
  lesson from Haxe's late threading-capability retrofit); a third backend just declares a smaller set and
  the existing check starts biting. (A `StubBackend` test exercises the refusal today.)

This is the **survivor pattern**: Kotlin Multiplatform makes the common surface literally the intersection;
Haxe (`target.threaded`…), Rust (`cfg`/`target_feature`), LLVM target features, and Protobuf editions all
use named, declared, compile-time-enforced capability flags. The dead .NET→JS transpilers (JSIL, SharpKit,
Bridge.NET) had **no published, enforced capability contract** and so miscompiled in the corners — exactly
what this clause prevents. (One nuance: extension methods *already* differ in call-site between C# and TS —
method-call vs free function, SPEC §6.3 — so the capability is precisely "call-site-preserving extension
methods"; a backend may instead opt into a documented free-function lowering rather than gate the feature
out entirely. Tiers: native / idiomatic-with-import / free-function fallback.)

## 4. Architecture

Modeled on **Fable** (the closest analogue: existing-frontend-style → one shared typed IR → per-target
backends with a "Replacements" library + a pretty-printer).

### 4.1 Pipeline
```
source (.pg) → lexer (trivia-bearing) → parser → AST
            → name resolution + static type-check (diagnostics emitted HERE, on a near-source form)
            → lower to ONE high-level, typed, tree-shaped IR (desugaring folded in)
            → per-target backend: stdlib "replacements" + construct lowering
            → hand-written pretty-printer per target  → .cs / .ts  (+ source map where applicable)
```

### 4.2 The IR decision
**A single high-level, typed, tree-shaped IR — NOT SSA, NOT lowered to a common denominator.** SSA
destroys the loop/name structure needed for readable output; the common-denominator approach yields ugly
or impossible output. Keep the IR high-level and **specialize per target** (C# keeps `foreach`/`async`
natively; a weaker construct is lowered only where a target lacks it). C# and TS overlap massively (both
typed, OO, closures, generics, async), so lowering is needed only at the divergences (C# value
types/nominal typing vs TS structural typing/`Symbol.dispose`).

### 4.3 Implementation language — **C++** (decision, with the tradeoff logged)
**Chosen: C++20**, single self-contained native CLI, zero runtime dependency (consistent with the
from-scratch, zero-native-deps spirit of the sibling repos; the same path Haxe/Nim took with OCaml).
- **Consequence:** a C++ host **cannot** emit via Roslyn `SyntaxFactory` (C#) or `ts-morph` (TS). The
  backends therefore **hand-write the C# and TS pretty-printers** over the IR. This is normal for native
  compilers (Haxe hand-emits every target) and keeps the toolchain dependency-free, at the cost of
  writing/maintaining the emitters ourselves.
- **Alternative considered — C# + Roslyn host:** would let the C# backend reuse Roslyn's emitter and
  matches the house .NET stack, but adds a .NET runtime dependency to the tool and doesn't help the TS
  side. *Recorded as the main fork in the road; revisit only if hand-written emitters prove painful.*
- **Reinforced by the plugin model (2026-06-28):** a self-contained native CLI means **plugin *users* need
  no SDK/runtime** — a Roslyn host would force every consumer to install the .NET SDK merely to transpile.
  This holds *because* downloaded plugins are **declarative data, not loadable code** (so the host needs no
  managed plugin runtime); backends themselves are declarative specs the core interprets. See
  [`../design/plugins-and-targets.md`](../design/plugins-and-targets.md).
- **The build-integration payoff (P11):** because the CLI is a self-contained native binary, it can be
  shipped inside a NuGet package's `build/` targets and run during `dotnet build` to transpile `.pg` → `.cs`
  with **no extra SDK/runtime** for the consumer — the `Grpc.Tools` pattern, where a native compiler runs at
  build to feed `@(Compile)`. A managed/Roslyn host couldn't be embedded as cleanly. See PLAN P11.

### 4.4 Standard library & platform APIs — the bounded strategy
The investigation's headline cost. Polyglot bounds it deliberately:
- **A small portable std** written in the source language (collections, strings, math, iterators) compiled
  to every target — the only thing guaranteed identical everywhere.
- **Target-gated native access via an `expect`/`actual` split** (Kotlin's model): portable code may name a
  capability (time, env, IO) via an `expect` declaration; each target supplies an `actual`. Platform APIs
  (`document`/`window` on JS, `System.*` on .NET) live **only** in target-gated regions — the portable
  core is compiler-forbidden from touching them (kills the #1 portability bug class).
- **String↔number parsing is a static method on the target type** — `i32.parse(s)`, `i64.parse(s)`,
  `f64.parse(s)` (throw on invalid input) plus `i32.tryParse(s): i32?` (nullable, non-throwing). It is
  deliberately **not a cast**, for two reasons: (1) a cast `(T)x` is a *total* numeric→numeric conversion
  that can never fail, whereas parsing text *can* fail — folding parse into cast syntax would hide that a
  `(i32)s` might throw; and (2) **C# cannot cast `string`→`int`** at all, so `(i32)stringExpr` couldn't even
  lower to a C# cast — it would have to secretly mean `int.Parse`, giving one syntax two semantics. It is
  also **not a free `parseI32` function**: parse is exactly *one* method per numeric type (you must name the
  target), so it's irreducible, not the per-type free-function swamp that motivated casts-over-`toI64()`.
  Lives in the portable std, realized per target (C# `int.Parse`/`int.TryParse`, JS `Number`/parse + range
  checks). This implies the language supports **static methods on types** (built-in on the primitives;
  `static fn` members on user types follow the same shape).
- **An FFI escape hatch** (`extern` / inline-target blocks) as the pressure valve past any unbound API.
- **No promise of broad coverage.** Bind what's used; bindings are auto-generatable in *shape* (from
  `.d.ts` / .NET metadata / WebIDL) but always need hand-written semantic overrides — so coverage grows
  on demand, never "complete."

> **Refinement (2026-06-28) — the plugin architecture.** The above is sharpened to its endpoint: the
> **core is a pure translator + a declarative emit engine** with *zero* hardcoded target/platform/SDK
> knowledge. **All** of it — bindings, replacements, capability `actual`s, and even the **target backends
> themselves** — lives in **declarative plugins** the engine interprets (C#/TS bundled; Python and others
> downloadable). Two tiers: **downloaded plugins are declarative data only** (safe to fetch, no host
> runtime, versioned + integrity-verified), while **local plugins may be full-power** for what the
> declarative DSL can't express. A **workspace config (`pgconfig.json`)** declares the target *environments*
> (desktop/web/mobile/…) and the plugins+versions in use; `pg` downloads them to a shared cache, and
> off-target/-environment use is a compile error, never a miscompile. Faithfulness (§3.C) and determinism

### 4.5 Modules, imports & name resolution (design — 2026-06-29)
P8 shipped the std as real `.pg` modules (`std.collections`, `std.io`) resolved from an embedded registry,
but with three rough edges: a dotted import syntax, no cross-file user modules, and a "merge everything,
collisions are accidental" model. The decided design (from a three-track investigation):

- **Import syntax — TypeScript-style, quoted specifier.**
  `import { readText, writeText as wt } from "std.io"`, plus `import * as io from "std.io"` (namespace) and
  bare `import "std.io"` (link only). `from` is a **contextual identifier** (not reserved — `from` is too
  common a name to burn), matching how `as` already works. The module specifier is a **quoted string**
  (`StringLit`), which is the load-bearing call: a bare specifier (`"std.io"`, `"app.physics"`) is a logical
  module name, while a `./`-prefixed one (`"./physics"`, `"../shared/vec"`) is importer-relative — the
  Node/TS/Deno convention, and impossible to express with a bare dotted path. Cost is localized: `ImportDecl`
  gains per-name aliases + a namespace field, `parseImport`/`importStr` are rewritten, **no lexer/token
  change**, and ~14 existing `.pg` import lines migrate. (`InterpString` specifiers — a `"…${}…"` — are
  refused with a clear diagnostic.)

- **User-module resolution — a pluggable `ModuleResolver`, Core stays IO-free.** `compile()` gains one
  optional `ModuleResolver*` parameter (default `nullptr` = std-only, so every existing caller and the
  in-process tests are unchanged). Core owns the **transitive load + dedup + cycle-detection + post-order
  merge** loop (generalizing today's `linkStdModules`); the resolver only answers "specifier (+ importer)
  → source text." The **CLI** implements it with `std::filesystem` (a bare dotted specifier `a.b.c` →
  `<root>/a/b/c.pg`; a relative `./x` → relative to the importer; `std.*` → the embedded registry first);
  the **tests** implement it with an in-memory map (no disk). Import cycles are a clear diagnostic
  (`a → b → a`), never a hang or miscompile. The source root comes from a `--root` flag now, from
  `pgconfig.json` later (ties into §4.4/P10).

- **Name collisions — refuse loudly, resolve with `as`.** Aligning with the §3 "never miscompile" law:
  **selective imports actually restrict visibility** (only the named symbols enter the importing file's
  scope — today's merge-everything is the bug to fix), and any collision is a **hard error naming both
  sources**, fixable only by aliasing one with `as`. Cases: two modules exporting one name → error;
  import vs local decl → error; import vs a **builtin** (`i32`, `Error`, `Iterable`) → error (builtins can't
  be shadowed); same module imported twice → already deduped. **Functions are special:** a same-name import
  with a *different signature* merges into the existing overload set (legal, per the native-overloading
  model); only a *same-signature* clash is a duplicate error. This also closes today's silent last-wins
  overwrite holes for top-level values, union constructors, and extensions.

- **Exports — all top-level declarations are module-public for now.** A `private` opt-out marker
  (SPEC §11's stated intent) is **deferred**; the loader already computes the per-module export set the
  collision/visibility rules need. Output stays single-file per target: multi-file `.pg` input merges into
  one root unit, so the emitted `.cs`/`.ts` is still one file (no conformance-harness redesign — just a
  directory-input + `--root` convention).

> **Status (P12 implemented, 2026-06-29).** Shipped: the import **syntax** (`import { a, b as c } from
> "spec"`, `* as ns`, bare); the **`ModuleResolver`** seam + transitive cross-`.pg` loading (dedup, cycle
> detection, dependencies-first merge; CLI filesystem resolver with `--root`, in-memory test resolver); and
> **collision detection** — every top-level name category now refuses a duplicate (types via `declareType`,
> functions by signature with overloads allowed, and the previously-silent value / union-case / extension
> holes now closed). **Deferred to a P12 phase-2** (needs a per-file import-scope table, which the current
> merge-into-one-unit model doesn't have): *selective-import visibility restriction* (today a selective
> import validates its names but still merges the whole module's public decls) and **`as` rebinding**
> (parsed, recorded, but not yet semantically applied). The safety property — never silently shadow/
> miscompile — holds today; the encapsulation niceties are the follow-up.

### 4.6 Std-as-real-modules + the `lib` prelude (design — 2026-06-29; ✅ shipped — 2026-06-30)
The module system exposed a contradiction: `print` and the `Math` namespace *were* **hardcoded builtins**, yet
the samples `import { print } from "std.io"` / `import { sqrt } from "std.math"` — which the P12 import
validation actively **rejected** (`std.io` had no `print`; `std.math` didn't exist). The samples only
"passed" because the fidelity gate `fmt`s them, never compiles. This is now resolved (P13): `print`/`Math` are
real std-module exports and the samples compile via `tests/samples/run-compile.ps1`. Decision (the language
designer's call):
**`print` and `Math` become real std-module exports — usable only via import — while `i32.parse` & friends
stay global primitive static methods.** Ergonomics are restored by a **`lib` prelude**, not by keeping
builtins. A two-track investigation found the design clean:

- **`std.math` — an `extern class Math`** of bound static members (`sqrt`/`ln`/`floor`/`ceil` → f64; generic
  `min<T>`/`max<T>`/`abs<T>` → `T`) plus bound `PI`/`E` constants, each an `actual(target) extern("…")` arm.
  The `Math.sqrt(x)` / `Math.PI` **call surface is unchanged** (still a static member of a type named `Math`).
  Type-preservation for `min`/`max`/`abs` falls out of ordinary generic-return typing (no special sema rule),
  and the TS-BigInt problem dissolves: an operator-ternary template (IIFE-form, to keep evaluate-once) works
  for both `number` and `bigint`. This **deletes all `Math` special-casing** across sema/lower/emit
  (`mathArity`, the `Math` namespace branch, `Math.PI/E`, the C# `mathRename`, the TS BigInt IIFE).

- **`print` — a generic `std.io` export** `expect fn print<T>(x: T)` + per-target `actual` `extern`
  (`Console.WriteLine($0)` / `console.log($0)`). Two behaviors carry over without keeping print a builtin:
  (1) the i64/u64 → `String(…)` wrap (so TS doesn't print a trailing `n`) becomes **i64/u64 TS `actual`
  overloads** — pure data, picked by the existing overload scoring; (2) the "this type isn't printable"
  diagnostic is kept as a **one-line sema guard on calls to `std.io.print`** — substituting for a `Printable`
  bound the language needn't grow yet. This deletes the `isPrint` flag and `printFn` machinery.

- **The `lib` prelude — auto-import without losing the "everything is a real import" model.** A workspace
  `lib: ["io", "math"]` auto-imports those std modules into every file, so `print(…)`/`Math.sqrt(…)` need no
  explicit import. Mechanism: a `LibConfig` (just specifiers) is passed to `compile()`; it **synthesizes one
  whole-module `ImportDecl` per entry**, tagged lib-origin, and the existing `linkModules` merges them.
  **A `lib` entry is a module specifier resolved through the same chain as `import`:** a *bare word* (`"io"`)
  is sugar for the std module `std.io`, while a *qualified* name (`"acme.physics"`) is used as-is and resolved
  via the resolver / (future) plugin registry — so a **third-party plugin auto-imports by its own namespace**,
  with no per-publisher special-casing. **Precedence (Rust-prelude / Python-builtins / TS-`lib` semantics):** a
  lib-imported decl is *ambient and lowest-priority* — it **loses silently** to any user declaration or
  explicit import of the same name (a pre-link `dropShadowedLibDecls` pass drops it before sema's collision
  tables build); explicit-vs-explicit collisions still hard-error (P12 unchanged), and lib-vs-lib collisions
  error (a prelude must be internally consistent). Config source: a `--lib` CLI flag now, `pgconfig.json`
  `"lib"` later (P10) — the Core stays IO-free (receives names, not files). **`lib` is the hard prerequisite**
  for the print/Math migration: without it, every `.pg` would need explicit `import … from "std.io"/"std.math"`.

Net effect: the std becomes honestly import-based (no magic builtins except the primitive `i32.parse`
static methods and the core `Error`/`Iterable` types), the broken samples become *compilable* (and join a
compile check, not just `fmt`), and hello-world stays `print(…)` via `lib: ["io"]`. See **PLAN P13**.

> **Known mechanism gap (note 2026-06-29, to close in P10).** The "Binding" plugin mechanism (`extern class`
> + `actual(target) extern("…")`) currently binds **member/property access** for *any* type, but **cannot
> yet bind a plugin class's own type-name → target type, nor its construction** — only the std-blessed
> `List`/`Iterable`/`Error` (and `List<T>()`) are hardcoded. So a user plugin class's type name and `new T(…)`
> emit literally; it's usable today only for methods on params/FFI results. Letting a binding declare its
> target type spelling (feeding the P9 backend type table) + a constructor template is **P10** work — the
> Binding mechanism's complete form. See PLAN P10 and `design/backend-spec.md` §4a.

## 5. Testing strategy
- **Unit tests** per pass (lexer, parser, type-checker, each backend) — the `MintPlayer.Polyglot.Tests`
  project (a tiny zero-dependency assert harness to start).
- **Golden-output tests:** source → emitted C#/TS compared against checked-in baselines (the TypeScript-
  team model). Catches emitter regressions.
- **Differential conformance (the crown jewel):** for a program emitted to *both* targets, compile & run
  both and assert identical results on a shared input suite. This is exactly the FruitCake parity test —
  Polyglot turns "keep two ports in sync" into a CI gate. Per §3.D, numeric programs gate on tolerance +
  behavioural equality, not bit-equality.
- **Refusal tests:** every 🔴 feature must produce a clear, actionable diagnostic — not a miscompile.

## 6. Milestone roadmap
Full detail in [PLAN.md](PLAN.md). Summary:
- **P0 — Solution skeleton.** ✅ `.sln` + Core lib + CLI (`--version`/`--help`) + test harness.
- **P1 — Language design v0.1.** ✅ Locked (`docs/lang/`): grammar + spec doc + sample programs; the
  deliberately-small surface checked against the §3 contract.
- **P2 — Walking skeleton (MVP).** ✅ Thinnest end-to-end slice: a minimal subset through lexer→parser→
  typer→IR→**both** hand-written backends; `polyglot build` emits running C# + TS with identical stdout
  (the **differential conformance test** stands up here, not at P5). Proved the "one IR serves both
  targets" bet.
- **P3 — Full front-end.** ✅ Full P1 grammar parses (incl. real string interpolation); `.pg` pretty-printer
  (`polyglot fmt`) round-trips all 10 samples idempotently (fidelity gate in `/build-and-test`).
- **P4 — Full semantics + IR.** ✅ Resolution + nominal type system + match exhaustiveness; a separate
  typed IR (`ir.hpp`) produced by a lowering pass; backends emit from the IR.
- **P5 — Backends to full §3.A.** Widen both C#/TS pretty-printers to the entire surface; golden baselines
  both targets; the differential suite grows.
- **P6 — Faithfulness pass.** int32 masking, the §3.C relaxations (documented), the §3.B refusals (with
  diagnostics).
- **P7 — Std core + expect/actual.** Minimal portable std (math, basic collections) + the target-gated
  binding mechanism + an FFI hatch.
- **P8 — Dogfood FruitCake physics.** Express the circle-physics solver in `.pg`; generate `.cs` + `.ts`;
  wire the differential conformance test against the existing MintPlayer.AI twins. *North star.*
- **P9 — Declarative backend engine + DSL.** Extract a declarative backend format from the two native
  backends; re-express C#/TS as specs the core interprets (gate: byte-for-byte vs. native golden output).
- **P10 — Plugin distribution + ecosystem.** `pgconfig.json` + download/cache/verify/version; availability by
  target+environment; build-dependency threading; the local full-power tier; proof = a **downloaded
  declarative Python backend** + a binding plugin, with **no core change**. The endpoint of §4.4 — see
  [`../design/plugins-and-targets.md`](../design/plugins-and-targets.md).
- **P11 — Build integration (the `.pg`-aware NuGet / npm on-ramp).** A NuGet package that auto-transpiles
  `.pg` → `.cs` **before `dotnet build`** with no manual step — modeled on `Grpc.Tools` (native CLI shipped
  per-RID in the package; `build/` props+targets hooking `BeforeTargets="CoreCompile"`, generating into
  `obj/` and joining `@(Compile)`; incremental; runs in design-time builds). **Non-transitive**
  (`DevelopmentDependency`/`PrivateAssets`). The payoff of the §4.3 zero-runtime-dep native CLI: the
  consuming dev needs no extra SDK/runtime. Depends only on a stable CLI, so it can ship independently of
  P9/P10. A sibling npm/build-script story does the same for TS.
- **P13 — Std as real modules + the `lib` prelude.** ✅ `print`/`Math` are real `std.io`/`std.math` exports
  (not builtins); a `lib` prelude auto-imports them ambiently. Also delivered the §4.6 type-mapping/
  construction binding (P10 precursor) — `extern class`es declare their per-target type + ctor, and
  `List`/`Error`/`Iterable` are fully dogfooded onto it (zero hardcoded type mappings in the emitters). See
  §4.6 and PLAN P13.
- **P14 — Emitted-output correctness + `Option<T>`.** ✅ A compile-run gate (`run-emit.ps1` builds the C#,
  runs the TS) caught a cluster of output-only miscompiles the transpile gate missed — all fixed; **all 10
  samples now compile+run**. Added a faithful **`Option<T>`** generic union for nullable generics (§3.C),
  generic unions, interfaces/indexers/record-implements emission, `std.strings` (bound extension methods),
  char literals, and faithful bool/float printing. See PLAN P14.
- **Stretch:** further targets as downloadable backends, source maps, **editor tooling** (a TextMate
  highlighting grammar for `.pg` — independent of the compiler, ships early for VS Code *and* Visual Studio
  2022+; plus an **LSP** server `polyglot lsp` built on the frontend-as-a-library, with thin VS Code and
  Visual Studio (VSIX) clients), a plugin registry + signing/trust infrastructure. (See PLAN Stretch.)

## 7. Honest ceiling & risks
| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| **Scope creep kills it** (the universal cause of death) | The §3 support/refuse contract is the law; new features must justify themselves against it. Faithful-by-default + *published* relaxations, never silent ones. |
| Hand-written emitters are tedious (C++ choice) | Accepted, normal for native compilers; the §4.3 alternative (C#/Roslyn) is on record if it bites. |
| Stdlib/platform surface is unbounded | Bind-what's-used + target-gated + FFI hatch; explicitly *no* broad-coverage promise. |
| Cross-target float determinism expectations | §3.D honesty clause: only `+−×÷√` reproducible; fixed-point std type for code that needs identity; tests gate on tolerance. |
| Solo bus-factor / long timeline | This is a **craft/long-haul project**, not on any delivery critical path. Decoupled from MintPlayer.AI's M30 (which ships via hand-ports + conformance test regardless). Polyglot *earns* the right to generate the physics only once mature. |

## 8. Relationship to MintPlayer.AI (M30)
MintPlayer.AI's FruitCake client-side move ships **now** with hand-ported physics locked by a conformance
test (M30). Polyglot is the **long game**: if/when it matures through P8, it generates that physics from
one source and the hand-ports retire — while the *same* conformance test remains, now guarding the
generator. The dream never blocks the delivery; the delivery gives the dream its first real target.
