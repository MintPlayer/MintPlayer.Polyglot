# MintPlayer.Polyglot — agent guide

A **cross-SDK transpiler**: one small source language → idiomatic, readable **C#/.NET** and
**TypeScript/JS**. A long-haul personal craft project, not on any delivery deadline.

**Read first:** `docs/prd/POLYGLOT_PRD.md` (vision, scope contract, architecture) and
`docs/prd/PLAN.md` (P0–P8 roadmap). This file is just the always-on rules.

## Prime directive — hold the scope line
The PRD §3 **support / refuse contract** is the law. Every multi-target transpiler that died (JSIL,
SharpKit, Bridge.NET) died of scope creep. Before adding any feature, check it against §3:
- **Supported (§3.A):** operators, properties/indexers, extension methods, exceptions, `using`,
  iterators, pattern matching/ADTs, enums, closures, overloading, strings (both targets are UTF-16).
- **Refused (§3.B), with a clear diagnostic — never a miscompile:** threads/locks, runtime reflection,
  finalizers/GC hooks, `decimal`, `unsafe`/pointers, `dynamic`/runtime code-gen, bit-exact cross-target
  floats.
- **Faithful-by-default with a *published* relaxation list (§3.C):** int overflow masking, int64→BigInt,
  opt-in `Math.fround` strict floats, structural equality. Never relax silently — document it.
- **Determinism honesty (§3.D):** only `+ − × ÷ √` are reproducible across .NET and JS; transcendentals
  are not. Don't promise bit-exact float parity; offer a fixed-point std type instead.

## Principled fix over workaround
This is a long-haul craft project — prefer the **root-cause fix** over an expedient patch, even when the
patch is smaller. When a problem traces to a missing language/compiler capability, build (or plan) that
capability rather than papering over the symptom. Example (2026-06-29): a generic call's return type wasn't
substituted, so `Math.max(i64,i64)` would print `20n` vs `20`; the workaround was to wrap every `print` arg
in `String()`, but the principled fix was **real TypeArg inference** (bind type params from args, substitute
the return) — which fixes the whole class of generic-call bugs, not just `print`. Take that path. If a
workaround is genuinely warranted (time-boxed, the real fix is out of scope), say so explicitly and leave a
note pointing at the principled follow-up — never let a silent shortcut masquerade as the design.

## Key decisions (don't relitigate without reason)
- **C++20**, single self-contained native CLI, zero runtime deps. Consequence: **no Roslyn / no ts-morph**
  — the C# and TS backends **hand-write** their pretty-printers over the IR (the Haxe path). The C#/Roslyn
  alternative is recorded in PRD §4.3 as the fork to revisit only if hand-emitters become painful.
- **One high-level, typed, tree-shaped IR. NOT SSA, NOT a common denominator.** Specialize per target.
- Targets: **C# and TS first.** More targets are post-P8 stretch.

## Build / run (Windows)
Open `MintPlayer.Polyglot.sln` in a C++-capable VS (*Desktop development with C++* workload), or build
from MSBuild:
```
msbuild MintPlayer.Polyglot.sln /p:Configuration=Debug /p:Platform=x64
x64\Debug\MintPlayer.Polyglot.Cli.exe --version      # -> 0.1.2
x64\Debug\MintPlayer.Polyglot.Tests.exe              # -> all tests pass
```
**One-shot gate** (build → unit tests → differential C#/TS conformance): `pwsh scripts/build-and-test.ps1`
— or invoke the **`/build-and-test`** skill (`.claude/skills/build-and-test/`). Needs `dotnet` + `node`
for the conformance stage.
TOOLCHAIN: the projects target PlatformToolset **v145** / VCProjectVersion **18.0**, so they **require
VS 2026 (the "18" generation)** — by design; this is a VS-2026-only project. The build is **VS 18
"Insiders"** (v145 → MSVC 14.51):
- IDE:     `C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\18\Insiders\Common7\IDE\devenv.exe`
- MSBuild: `C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\18\Insiders\MSBuild\Current\Bin\MSBuild.exe`

VS 2019 BuildTools (v142) and VS 2022 (v143) are both **insufficient** for v145 — don't build with them.

**POSIX build (Linux)** — P22 slice 2, the `.vcxproj` stays the Windows source of truth (macOS not
planned; the CMake file still supports it if that changes): a root
`CMakeLists.txt` mirrors the three projects (verified on WSL Ubuntu with g++/cmake). `cmake -S . -B build
-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release && cmake --build build` → `build/polyglot` (the CLI, static-linked libstdc++) +
`build/polyglot-tests`. `scripts/check-buildfile-parity.ps1` guards `.vcxproj`↔CMake source-list drift
(first stage of `build-and-test.ps1`).

## Layout
```
src/MintPlayer.Polyglot.Core/   # compiler library (lexer→parser→typed IR→backends); public headers in include/
src/MintPlayer.Polyglot.Cli/    # the `polyglot` CLI
tests/MintPlayer.Polyglot.Tests/# unit + (later) differential-conformance tests
docs/prd/                       # PRD + plan
docs/lang/                      # SPEC.md + grammar.ebnf + samples/*.pg  (P1 design)
```

## Status & next step
P0 ✅ built. P1 ✅ language design v0.1 (`docs/lang/`: grammar.ebnf + SPEC.md + samples). **P2 ✅ done —
the walking-skeleton MVP:** the full pipeline (lexer→parser→typer→typed tree→**C# + TS** emitters) for a
minimal subset (`fn`, i32/f64 arithmetic, `let`/`var`, `if`/`while`, calls, `print`). `polyglot build
foo.pg` emits `foo.cs` + `foo.ts`; both compile/run with **identical stdout** — the differential
conformance gate (`tests/conformance/run-diff.ps1`) is green. 20 in-process tests pass.

To verify: build (VS 18 Insiders MSBuild), then run `x64\Debug\MintPlayer.Polyglot.Tests.exe` and
`pwsh tests/conformance/run-diff.ps1` (needs `dotnet` + `node` on PATH).

**P3 ✅** full P1 grammar parses (incl. interpolation); `polyglot fmt` round-trips all 10 samples
(`tests/fidelity/run-roundtrip.ps1`). **P4 ✅** semantics + a **separate typed IR**: resolution + nominal
typing + match exhaustiveness in `sema.cpp`; AST→IR `lower.cpp` into `ir.hpp`; backends emit from the IR
(pipeline = lexer→parser→sema→lower→IR→backend). Full sema runs on self-contained programs (std-using
samples checked end-to-end at P7). **P5 ✅ done — full §3.A surface lowers + emits to both targets:** the
**backend-interface seam** (`Backend` abstraction + registry), records, enums, unions + pattern matching,
operators/properties, **classes** (inheritance + `super`), **`for…in`** (ranges + iterables), **iterators
(`yield`)**, **exceptions**, **`use`/disposal**, **closures/lambdas** (incl. bare `x => …`), **extension
methods** (C# `this`-methods / TS free functions), and **generics** (`<T>` + bounds + construction type
args). `Iterable`/`Error` are core builtin types. **§3.E per-target capability gating is implemented +
active** (`backend.hpp` `Feature` enum + `Backend::supports`; `capability.cpp` + `compile()` refuse any
used feature a target can't emit — C#/TS declare the full set so nothing gates yet; a StubBackend test
proves it bites). **P6 ✅ done — faithfulness pass:** §3.B **refusal diagnostics** ("Polyglot refuses X");
**all integer widths faithful** (i8…u32 narrowing, i64/u64 → **BigInt**); **structural equality** for
records; **explicit casts `(T)x`** + **implicit lossless widening** (no conversion methods); **function
overloading** (C# native name / TS param-mangled). *Deferred tail:* strict-f32 `Math.fround`, null
normalization (`lock`/`unsafe` statement refusals ✅ done — parseStmt emits a targeted §3.B message).
**P7 ✅ done — std core + the three plugin mechanisms as
first-party code:** **static methods** (`Type.method()`); **`i32.parse`/`f64.parse`** (string→number);
the **`Math`** namespace (replacement); **`expect`/`actual`** target-gated capabilities (each backend
emits only its `actual`); **`extern("…")`** raw-code FFI (binding); and the **portable-core guard**
(`extern` refused outside an `actual`). **P11 added to the roadmap** (PLAN/PRD): a NuGet package that
auto-transpiles `.pg`→`.cs` before `dotnet build` (Grpc.Tools-style, native CLI per-RID, non-transitive);
depends only on a stable CLI, so it can ship independently of P9/P10.
**P8 ✅ done — the FruitCake physics dogfood (★ north star).** `docs/lang/samples/fruitcake_sketch.pg`
(a full sequential-impulse circle solver, f64 so `+−×÷√` are bit-exact cross-target per §3.D) transpiles
to C# **and** TS with byte-identical output (`bodies=1 scored=1`); it's conformance program #27, all green.
Delivered: **`List<T>` as a first-party `.pg` std type** (not an intrinsic) via the new **binding
mechanism** — a method/property body of `actual(target) extern("…template…")` arms where `$this`
(receiver) + `$0…` (args) substitute at each call site, and a `$this = …` arm emits a receiver
*assignment* (so `list.clear()` → C# `xs.Clear()` / TS `xs = []`; `list.removeAll(p)` → TS
`xs = xs.filter(e => !((p)(e)))`). **`extern class`** marks a native-backed type (not emitted; maps to a
target type). **Embedded std module**: `import std.collections.{ List }` links an embedded `collections.pg`
(no FS resolver yet). List element typing (`[...]`, `lst[i]`, `for x in`/`for (a,b) in`) is compiler-level.
Also lowered+emitted for the first time (all previously hit a silent `0`): `null`, `x!` (→ non-null cast),
`??`, string interpolation, index, tuple literal, top-level globals, tuple destructuring. *Deferred tail
(unchanged):* strict-f32 `Math.fround`, null normalization (`lock`/`unsafe` refusals now ✅ done).
**P12 ✅ phase-1 done — modules/imports** (PRD §4.5): TS-style `import { a, b as c } from "spec"` (+ `* as ns`,
bare; `from`/`as` contextual, quoted specifier so `"std.io"`=logical, `"./x"`=relative); a **`ModuleResolver`**
seam (`compile(src, target, ModuleResolver*=nullptr)`, Core stays IO-free) with transitive cross-`.pg`
loading — dedup, cycle detection, deps-first merge; CLI `FileModuleResolver` (`--root`), in-memory test
resolver; **collision detection** closes the silent value/union-case/extension holes. *Phase-2 deferred*
(needs a per-file import-scope table): selective-import visibility restriction + `as` rebinding.
std.io ships File bindings (readText/writeText/…) via the capability mechanism; std is still embedded-source.
**P9 ✅ done — declarative backend engine + DSL extracted (validated across three backends)** (design + slice
log: `docs/design/backend-spec.md`). A `{Spec data + Hooks}` split across byte-for-byte no-op slices:
**`EmitterBase`** (`emitter_base.hpp`/`.cpp`) owns the statement walk + buffer/indentation + block abstraction
and reads all per-target data through one `spec()` accessor; **`BackendSpec`** is the extracted declarative
DSL — **all** per-target data: scalar/suffix/operator/bracket tables + block style + statement terminator +
throw keyword + bool/null literal spellings (string escaping is the shared `renderString` primitive). Every
backend, incl. Python, is now a `{Spec + Hooks}` instance. The residual **hook surface** is genuine behavior:
`emitExpr`/`emitStmtTarget`/`localDecl`/`yieldStmt`/`rethrowStmt` + the per-target declaration emitters.
Extraction proved (and a third, non-sibling backend confirmed) the **expression walk + declaration shapes are
irreducibly per-target** — they can't be flattened to data without an embedded DSL the zero-dep core forbids.
**P9-V ✅ done — third backend (Python) validation spike** (`emit_python.cpp`, gate `tests/conformance/run-python.ps1`,
opt-in `--target python`). A non-sibling colon+indent target brought up to validate the engine generalizes,
now covering the **full §3.A surface — all 36 conformance programs (incl. the FruitCake north star) agree
byte-for-byte with the C# oracle**. It forced a real generalization (3-way `BlockStyle` + `stmtEnd` +
`throwKeyword` hook + block-style-agnostic `Use`, all verified C#/TS no-ops), after which the shared statement
layer served Python unchanged; declarations stay per-target (often cleaner — structural `==` via `__eq__`, no
`new`, exact bignum `int`, native dunders/generators, `except T as e`). The spike fixed **three latent bugs at
the root**, notably that **`break`/`continue` were silently dropped in lowering for all targets** (a §3.B
miscompile the C#/TS diff gate couldn't catch — both dropped them identically; now `ir::Break`/`Continue`
emit in the shared engine). `PythonBackend::supports` returns `true` for everything. The declarative DSL (P9
endpoint) can now be extracted from **three** backends instead of guessed. Slice log in PLAN §P9-V.
Follow-up ✅ (2026-07-01): a call to a portable fn (one with `actual`s) on a target lacking one now **refuses**
with a call-site diagnostic (`checkCapabilities`, call-site-keyed so unused portable fns are unaffected) —
closing that §3.B silent-broken-output gap.
**P13 ✅ done — std as real modules + the `lib` prelude** (PRD §4.6): `print` is now `std.io`'s generic
`expect/actual print<T>` (TS body wraps `console.log(String(x))` universally so bigint/number print like C#
`WriteLine`); `Math` is an `extern class Math` in `std.math` (bound static members + `PI`/`E`; `min/max/abs/round`
are call-site-inlined generic bindings — a generic C# `Math.Min<T>` wouldn't compile — constrained
`<T: INumber>`); `i32.parse` stays global, `Error`/`Iterable`/`INumber` stay core. **`INumber`** is a
compile-time-only numeric marker constraint (à la .NET's `System.Numerics.INumber<T>`, core `extern class`,
satisfied by `i8..u64`/`f32`/`f64`): sema rejects a non-numeric arg to any `<T: INumber>` generic ahead of
time (`checkNumericBounds`), and the bound is erased from emission (`csWhere`/`tsGenerics`). The **`lib` prelude** (`LibConfig` 4th arg to `compile()`, CLI `--lib io,math`)
auto-imports std modules ambiently and **silently loses to** any user/explicit decl of the same name; a bare
entry (`"io"`) means `std.io`, a qualified one (`"acme.physics"`) is a full specifier so third-party plugins
auto-import by their own namespace. Also delivered: **TypeArg inference** (bind generic params from arg types,
substitute the return) as the principled fix for generic-call return types; `List.removeAt`. The
`docs/lang/samples/*.pg` now **compile** (gate: `tests/samples/run-compile.ps1`), not just `fmt` — all 10
green. Two follow-up gaps the gate surfaced are now also fixed: **base-class member resolution**
(`findMember` walks `TypeInfo.bases`; lower's binding lookup walks `bases_`) with **`Error.message`** as a
per-target bound property (C# `$this.Message` / JS `$this.message`); and **extensions on a generic receiver**
(`liftExtensionGenerics` lifts free receiver type-vars like `List<T>`'s `T` into the extension's generics).
**P10 type-mapping/construction gap ✅ closed (2026-06-30) + full std/core dogfood.** An `extern class`
declares its per-target **type spelling** (`type { actual(target) extern("…$0…") }`; `$0,$1`=rendered type
args) and **construction** (binding arms on `init`; `$T`=mapped type, `$0,…`=ctor args; `Type(args)`→`ir::Bound`).
Carried as an `ir::ExternType` registry on the IR module that `csType`/`tsType` consult per-emit. **Dogfooded:**
`List` (in std.collections) + an always-linked **core prelude** (`compiler.cpp` `STD_CORE` via `linkCoreModule`)
declaring `extern class Error` (→`System.Exception`/`Error`, ctor, `message` property) and `Iterable`
(→`IEnumerable<$0>`/`Iterable<$0>`). The emitters now have **zero** hardcoded type mappings. Backlog: idiomatic
per-target member casing (PLAN P13).
**P15 ✅ done — single-threaded async/await** (design: **PRD §4.7**, from a 4-agent investigation). A colored
function like iterators: `isAsync` on `FunctionDecl`/`Member`/`ir::Function`/`ir::Method` (method `async`
promoted from `Member.modifiers` to a typed flag) + an `Await` expr node (AST + `ir::Await`) parsed at unary
precedence; author writes the unwrapped `T` and each backend synthesizes its wrapper (Option B — keeps `.pg`
portable): C# `async Task<T>` w/ `main().GetAwaiter().GetResult()`, TS `async … Promise<T>` w/ floating
`main();`, Python `async def` w/ `asyncio.run(main())`+`import asyncio`. Sema (`inAsync_`) validates `await`
only in an `async fn` + refuses `async`+`yield` (no async iterators v1); `Feature::Async` gates it (all 3
backends support it; bites only for a future PHP-like target). Conformance #38 `async_await.pg` agrees C#/TS
+ Python. **`await` typing is a real `Awaitable<T>` unwrap** (an async call types as the compile-time-only
`Awaitable<T>` via an `isAsync` bit on sema's `FnSig`/`MemberInfo`; `await` unwraps to `T`) — so sema catches
forgot-to-await (`return f()`/`print(f())` refuse) and awaited-non-async (`await plain()` refuses), mirroring
C#/TS. `Awaitable` is never author-written and never emitted. Shared engine unchanged, as designed.
**P16 ✅ (except the VS client) — editor tooling & the language server** (design: **PRD §4.8**, from a 4-agent
investigation; slice log: **PLAN §P16**). A shared TextMate grammar (`editors/vscode/syntaxes/`) + a zero-dep
**`polyglot lsp`** stdio JSON-RPC server built on a new front-end seam **`analyze()`** (returns the checked AST +
a position-indexed **`SemanticModel`** + a `SourceMap`, without lowering/emitting) and a sema-hook that records
defs/refs. Capabilities: diagnostics (live on-type), go-to-def (same-file + **cross-module** via `SourcePos.fileId`
+ `SourceMap` + `file://`, and **std** via `polyglot:<name>` virtual docs the server serves), hover, document
symbols, semantic tokens, formatting, references, rename (file-local), completion. The **VS Code extension** is a
thin `vscode-languageclient` client (plain JS, no bundler; F5 via repo-root `.vscode` → build CLI + `npm install`).
A minimal **`pgconfig.json`** (`{root,lib}`, CLI/LSP layer, core stays IO-free) drives module resolution. The CLI
now **statically links the CRT** (self-contained — see PRD §4.3). **P16d (Visual Studio client) 🚧 slices 1–4 built,
headless build green** — a VSIX at `editors/vs/` (`ILanguageClient` launching `polyglot lsp` + `polyglot` content
type + `.pg` association + the shared TextMate grammar bundled at build); builds with the VS 18 MSBuild
(`VSToolsPath` from `MSBuildExtensionsPath`; framework refs `System`+`System.ComponentModel.Composition`; manifest
`ProductArchitecture=amd64`; SDK 17.0 NuGet, `InstallationTarget [17.0,)`). **Interactive `devenv /rootsuffix Exp`
verification is the user's step** (not headless); Options page + custom-message std-docs/emit-preview deferred.
The P16 deferred tail is now **empty**. ✅ done:
live cross-file edits (a `BufferResolver` serves open unsaved imports; `didChange` re-analyzes all open docs);
semantic tokens/hover/def inside `polyglot:` std virtual docs (scheme added to the selector; std analyzed from
synced text, diagnostics suppressed); **member completion** (`obj.` — `SymbolDef.owner` on members; LSP analyzes a
repaired buffer to resolve the receiver type; `.` trigger char; `Math.` statics work; v1 skips inherited members +
`this.`); **in-scope local filtering** (parser records fn/method `bodyEnd`; sema stamps Local/Parameter defs with
`[scopeStart,scopeEnd]`; LSP offers a local only in-range); **non-ASCII UTF-16 position conversion** (guarded by a
`utf16_` flag so the utf-8 VS Code path is identity; `inCol`/`encRange`/semantic-token col+len convert per line).
**P17 ✅ done — live generated-output preview** (PRD §4.9, from a 2-agent investigation; slice plan PLAN §P17):
see a `.pg`'s emitted C#/TS/Python **live as you type**, rendered read-only into a `polyglot-gen:` virtual editor
opened beside the source (colored for free by the built-in target grammars). One new in-memory LSP request
`polyglot/emit` → `compile()` (no disk I/O, **zero Core change** — it's a CLI handler + client code over P16's
virtual-doc/custom-request plumbing); client-debounced request/response, one target per request, last-good-with-
stale-banner error UX (never a miscompile shown as valid). Delivered: `polyglot/emit` (spawn-tested), the
`polyglot-gen:` provider + follow-active-editor + 200 ms debounce. **"Show Generated Output" opens all three targets
at once** (one tab each, target-only gen URIs that follow the active `.pg`); an Explorer "Polyglot Outputs" tree
(`polyglot.openGenerated`, gated by a `polyglot.hasOutputs` context key) opens a single target on demand. Multi-root
is server-side (per-file `pgconfig.json` walk-up in `contextFor`). (The single-target status-bar switcher was built
then dropped on feedback.)
**P18 🚧 designed — data-driven backends (languages as pure-JSON plugins)** (PRD §4.10; DSL/interpreter detail
`docs/design/backend-spec.md` §6; packaging `docs/design/plugins-and-targets.md` §6.2; slice plan PLAN §P18; from a
4-agent investigation). Replace the compiled-in C#/TS/Python `Backend` classes + `Target` enum with a **bounded,
RCE-safe JSON emission DSL** (Design A — ~10 fixed interpreter primitives, non-Turing-complete, no plugin code) that
`EmitterBase` interprets, so a language is an installable npm-wrapped data plugin with no Core change. Reframes P9's
"irreducible 30%": ≈85% data with the base interpreter, ≈95%+ with a few *fixed* added Core primitives, <5% remainder
= target limits the §3.E gate refuses. Migration = P9's extract-from-working-backends + byte-identical dual-run +
delete-the-C++ discipline; `Target` enum → string name + validated `BackendHandle`; `analyze()` unchanged. **This is
the prerequisite the user set before publishing the editor extensions.** 🚧 **Slices 1–15 built** (as-built log:
PLAN §P18): specs + expression rules are JSON for **all three backends over one interpreter** (`backend_engine` —
primitives incl. `map`+item template; shared `IrExprCtx` seam + per-target ctx subclasses; stateful/faithfulness
machinery = fixed builtins); `Target`→`BackendHandle` ✅ (`findTarget(name)`, validated at resolve). Every slice
proven **byte-identical** (old-vs-new emitted-source diff across 38 programs × 3 targets). **P18's remaining tail is
superseded by P19.**
**P19 🚧 designed — 100% JSON plugins, the complete artifact** (PRD §4.11; design `docs/design/json-plugins.md`;
slice plan PLAN §P19; from a second 4-agent investigation, 2026-07-02). Close everything still imperative so a
language plugin is *entirely* JSON, steady-state **zero Core changes** for new languages: declaration rule tables +
`program` scaffold (`line`/`block`/`mapDecl`), type-rule tables (`type`), expr residue (`interleave`/`fold`/
`emitBlock`/`fresh`/`require`), **lowering absorbs module facts + temps** (each absorption its own byte-gated
slice), a **~10-entry generic builtin catalog** (pioneer-pays-once via `requiresCore`), the `polyglot-plugin.json`
artifact (tri-state capabilities `native|emulated|false`, **std overlays** collapsing `ir::Bound`/`ExternType`'s
cs/ts/py fields, load-time anti-silent-drop validation: every IR node kind has a rule OR capability `false`),
`polyglot install` + registry, proof = a downloaded 4th backend with zero Core change. **Slice 1 is two latent
§3.B fixes found live in the Python backend** (block-lambda + `With` emit sentinels into "valid" output) + moving
`i32.parse`/`f64.parse` to std `Bound` bindings. **Added (2026-07-02, 2-agent investigation): reserved/forbidden
identifiers** (`json-plugins.md` §7, PLAN §P19 slices 13–15) — plugin `identifiers` manifest block (keywords+escape
/ reserved scaffolding / runtime globals) + pgconfig `forbiddenIdentifiers` (per-project, target-scoped) + a
`checkReservedNames` pass; **identifiers only, never string/comment/extern text** (symbol-table-driven). The
investigation found 7 shipping collision miscompiles (3 silent — match-arm `_m`, union field `tag`, Python user
`_pg_idiv` which evades all gates) → hygiene slice 13 lands BEFORE the config feature. **Two user scope decisions (2026-07-02): no backward compat**
(C++ deletes in the same slice its byte gate passes; no `--legacy-backend`) **and zero embedded target specs** —
the CLI is a pure engine; C#/TS/Python are ordinary plugin packages (`plugins/<target>/` in this repo, published
to npm), resolved via `pgconfig.json` `targets`/`dependencies` (local `file:` → cache → registry); std *skeletons*
stay in Core, every per-target arm ships in its target's plugin. 🚧 **Slices 1–6 built (2026-07-03):** the
ENTIRE declaration layer is rule data on all three targets — Enum/Union/Interface/Method/Record/Class/
Function/Extension + the per-target `Program` module scaffold (globals, entry synthesis, C# Program/Extensions
wrappers, target-filtered `actual` fns) all evaluate through `runDeclRule` over shared decl contexts
(`ModuleDeclCtx`→`memberCtx`→per-kind ctxs; new `mapMembers` decl primitive) — each emit() is: build
maps/predicates → one `runDeclRule(Program)`. The operator `this`→`lhs` rebind became a lowering fact
(`ir::This.insideOperator`). **The generic builtin catalog (slice 6) is fully real:** all three backends have
ZERO targetBuiltins/targetGets — spec data drives keyword escaping + name mangling (`identifiers`), escape
maps, per-width int wraps (`wrapInt`), named tables (`opMethod`/`bigNarrow`), conversions (Cast `case` rules
over shared type-class facts), atom parens (`wrapAtom` kind-sets), and generics/bounds spelling (strategy +
INumber erasure); `fresh` (walrus temps) + `require` (prelude keys) are engine primitives; every DeclHooks
subclass is one line. Every slice byte-gated (117 emitted files identical) + strict-JSON-parse checked.
**Slice 7a–d built (2026-07-03): ONE `InterpretedEmitter` serves every backend.** For/Try are per-kind
STATEMENT rules (new `StmtCtx` + `{"indent":[…]}` primitive — TS's `__handled` catch chain composes from
line/indent/mapDecl); localDecl/yield/rethrow are spec data; Python's preludes are spec data (`preludes`
map + the entry fact). The three backend classes/ctxs/hooks/rule-key switches are DELETED — each
`emit_*.cpp` is now two JSON blobs + a one-line factory (`InterpretedEmitter(&spec, rules,
&ExternType::<field>, &Bound::<field>)`; the member picks are the last per-target parameter, collapsing at
slice 9's overlays). **Slices 7e–9 built (2026-07-03): `emit_*.cpp` NO LONGER EXIST; the loader validates; lowering is
per-target.** The backends are runtime-loaded **`plugins/<target>/polyglot-plugin.json`** artifacts
(`{schema, name, capabilities, spec, rules}`); Core's `loadBackend(bytes, error)` parses rules STRICTLY and
enforces (a) the **anti-silent-drop coverage contract** — a 37-row table pairs every emittable construct
with the capability that may excuse a missing rule; gaps need a declared `"false"` (§3.E compile refusal)
or `"emulated"` stance (Python: `blockLambdas:false`, `interfaces:emulated`; Python gained its `Char` rule);
(b) the **16-builtin fn catalog** (unknown `{"fn":…}` fails the load, not the output); (c) call/mapMembers
**reference existence**. Capabilities are tri-state. Zero backends compiled in — the CLI/tests load
`plugins/` next to the exe (post-build copy). **`lower(unit, target)` picks binding/extern arms at lowering**
— `ir::Bound`→one `tmpl`, `ir::ExternType`→one `typeTmpl`, `irTemplates` gone; `InterpretedEmitter` is
parameterized by exactly {spec, rules}. **Slices 9b + 12 built (2026-07-03): the P19 thesis is DEMONSTRATED — a language is a JSON file.**
9b: the embedded std sources are pure SKELETONS (zero `actual` arms in Core); plugin manifests carry the
**`std` overlay block** ({module → member → template}; 44 C#/TS, 39 Python); `injectStdOverlays` attaches the
active target's arms post-sema/pre-capability-gate (expect fns synthesize single-`extern` actuals; the parser
accepts empty binding blocks; a zero-actual expect counts as portable so un-overlaid calls refuse). 12: the
proof — **`plugins/php/polyglot-plugin.json`**, a PHP backend from ONE JSON file (`$`-vars as rule data,
`->`/`::`, intdiv+i32 masks, `.`-concat interpolation, keyword-escaped `print_`, `<?php` as Program data;
unsupported features declared `false` → §3.E refusals); the CLI build driver is target-agnostic (any loaded
plugin is a `--target`; manifest `fileExtension`). Emitted PHP verified by inspection (no php.exe here —
runtime differential TODO). **Slices 10–11 built (2026-07-03): distribution.** `pgconfig.json` `targets` (a bare `polyglot build` emits
the project's whole target set; no config = the historical cs+ts) + `dependencies` (`file:<dir>`).
Resolution: in-box `plugins/` → pgconfig `file:` → user cache (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\polyglot\plugins\`) → clean
refusal. **`polyglot install <dir|npm-name>`** validates via the new Core `validateBackend` (full slice-8
pipeline, no registration) and copies to the cache; bare names shell to `npm pack`+`tar` — **✅ verified
end-to-end against the live registry** (2026-07-04; needed a fix: extract from inside the temp dir, GNU tar
reads `C:\` as a remote host). All three channels verified with the PHP plugin. **9b member-arm gap
✅ closed** (bound members without this target's arm refuse at the use site). **npm packaging ✅ committed**
(`plugins/*/package.json` as `@mintplayer/polyglot-target-*` + `.github/workflows/publish-plugins.yml` via
the org's shared publish action; actual publish fires on push to main). **Slices 13–15 ✅ v1 (2026-07-03):
reserved/forbidden identifiers** — the 7 collision miscompiles are loud per-target refusals: plugin
`identifiers.reserved` (trailing `*` = prefix family) + `identifiers.globals`; `checkReservedNames`
(NameCollector over declaration sites ONLY — strings/comments/extern templates can never trip it);
pgconfig `forbiddenIdentifiers` (`{target-or-"*": [names]}`) carried on `LibConfig`. Three diagnostics
(reserved / shadows-global / pgconfig-forbidden). The LSP runs the check per configured pgconfig target so
refusals squiggle live. v1 is kind-blind + refuse-not-rename. **Slice 15 ✅:** every bare name hole in the
rule tables (116) wrapped in `{"fn":"ident"}` — keyword-named decls escape consistently at decl+reference+
type sites (C# `@switch`, python `global_`); TS declares no escape so its JS-reserved-words are
`identifiers.reserved` → honest refusals; `ident` dispatch added to `TypeRefCtx`/`EnumDeclCtx` (engine
gaps the byte gate caught). **P19 is COMPLETE and PUBLISHED (2026-07-04):** all four
`@mintplayer/polyglot-target-*` 0.1.0 packages are live on npmjs + GitHub Packages (npmjs publishes
DIRECTLY in the workflow — the shared org action fails npmjs silently; its GH-Packages leg works), the
VS Code extension is on the marketplace (`mintplayer.polyglot-lang`, displayName "MintPlayer Polyglot" —
plain "Polyglot" was taken), and `polyglot install <bare-name>` resolves from the live registry. Only the
PHP runtime differential remains (needs a php toolchain).
**P20 🚦 designed & GATED — alternative input syntaxes ("skins")** (PRD §4.12 + new contract clause **§3.F**;
design `docs/design/frontend-skins.md`; slice plan PLAN §P20; from a 4-agent investigation, 2026-07-02). Let devs
author in a familiar surface over the same §3.A semantics — Reason-over-OCaml, never "compile arbitrary C#".
Verdicts: **TS skin refused permanently** (surface *inverts* `.pg` semantics where faithfulness lives — one
`number` can't express widths, `as` erases vs `(T)x` truncates, `let` mutability inverted, `for..in` iterates
keys); **C# skin defensible but demand-gated** (widths/casts map 1:1 `int↔i32`; must invent `union`/selective
imports/range-`for`); **front-ends are compiled-in C++, never data plugins** (parsing = disambiguation + recovery
+ crisp diagnostics; grammar-as-data rejected — precedent unanimous, Reason/ReScript hand-write; the P19 manifest
may *declare* a frontend by name — symmetric packaging, asymmetric implementation); the seam is the unchecked AST
via `Frontend`/`FrontendHandle` mirroring `BackendHandle` (~1–2 days plumbing; LSP transfers free; `fmt` needs a
per-skin printer; convert = parse-A→print-B, so skin→`.pg` needs only the existing printer). Staged: Rosetta docs
(ungated slice 0) → seam (post-P19) → one-way `polyglot convert` (observed demand only) → `.pgcs` authoring skin
(double-gated). Gate to open the phase: P19 shipped + extensions published + real external demand + frozen
grammar. Nothing built yet; only docs may land early.
**P11 ✅ v1 built (2026-07-03, win-x64) — the `.pg`-aware NuGet:** `MintPlayer.Polyglot.MSBuild`
(`src/MintPlayer.Polyglot.MSBuild/`, assets-only, `DevelopmentDependency`, non-transitive `build/`) ships the
CLI + its `plugins/` under `tools/win-x64/` and transpiles `**/*.pg`→obj/ `BeforeTargets=CoreCompile`
(incremental, clean-aware, loud missing-RID error, `PolyglotTool`/`PolyglotLib`/`PolyglotRoot` overrides).
Gate: `tests/msbuild/run-nuget.ps1` (8 checks, all green). v1 limits recorded in PLAN §P11: ~~`Program`-wrapper
collision with top-level statements~~ (**✅ fixed 2026-07-04: the C# wrapper is `PolyglotProgram`/
`PolyglotExtensions` — pure rule data + reserved entries, csharp plugin 0.2.0; the gate's consumer now uses
top-level statements**), `internal` generated types, one-import-root per
project. **NuGet 0.0.1 is LIVE on nuget.org** (publish-plugins.yml, 2026-07-04). Remaining: more RIDs
(linux/mac need a cross-toolchain story), npm sibling.
**Prebuilt-CLI release channel ✅ (2026-07-04):** `.github/workflows/release.yml` — a `v*` tag push (or
dispatch) builds/gates Release on windows-latest, ships `polyglot-win-x64.zip` (exe + plugins) as a
GitHub Release, and **attests build provenance** (GitHub artifact attestations / SLSA / Sigstore; zip AND
inner exe are subjects) so `gh attestation verify <file> --repo MintPlayer/MintPlayer.Polyglot` proves
the binary came from this repo's workflow at a named commit.
**P21 ✅ done (2026-07-04, designed + built same day) — watch mode** (PRD §4.13; slice log PLAN §P21):
`--watch` as a FLAG on `build`/`check` (tsc convention, not a verb). CLI-layer only, **zero Core change** —
a `RecordingResolver` decorator over `FileModuleResolver` captures the transitive input closure `compile()`
discards; v1 watching is **portable timestamp polling** of that exact set (`(mtime,size)`, ~250 ms tick +
250 ms quiet-window debounce) behind a `FileWatcher` seam (self-trigger impossible — outputs never polled;
no RDCW edges; no thread). Console protocol **frozen + golden-tested** (`tests/watch/run-watch.ps1`):
`[HH:MM:SS] polyglot watch: building|rebuilding …` / `ABSPATH(LINE,COL): error: msg` (MSBuild-canonical,
watch stream only) / `… N error(s) — watching for changes` — the same regexes ship in the VS Code
`$polyglot-watch` background problemMatcher (task type + status-bar toggle running the task; LSP
emit-on-save rejected as wrong layering). Visual Studio gets the C#-host path FREE: one
`<Watch Include="@(PolyglotFile)" />` in the NuGet `.targets` makes `dotnet watch` re-transpile on `.pg`
edits (no VSIX change). Failed rebuilds keep watching and never touch last-good outputs. Plugins/targets
resolve once at startup (registry is load-once; manifest edits need a restart — recorded; a NEW plugin
target added to pgconfig loads live, since `resolveConfiguredTargets` re-runs per cycle). Built: watch.hpp
(header-only, unit-testable), the pgconfig walk-up-chain + unresolved-import candidate polling, the
20-assertion golden gate (`tests/watch/run-watch.ps1`, wired into `scripts/build-and-test.ps1`), the VS
Code task provider + status-bar toggle (extension 0.1.0), the NuGet `Watch` item (`run-nuget.ps1` now 9
checks). VS Code Problems-panel cycling is the user's interactive F5 check.
**Hotfix 0.1.1 ✅ (2026-07-04) — the `??` precedence miscompile** (PLAN §Hotfix 0.1.1; found live by the
MintPlayer.AI FruitCake pilot): the engine's `operatorPrecedence` table lacked `??`/bitwise/shifts, so
they fell to the TIGHTEST default and dropped required parens — `a + (b?.v ?? 0.0)` emitted bare,
reparsing as `(a + b?.v) ?? 0.0` (C# silently 0.0 / JS NaN — wrong AND divergent). Root fix in the
shared engine (zero plugin changes): the complete C-family table + two mixing guards (`??`×logical = JS
SyntaxError; comparison×comparison = Python chaining). Byte-audit proved the only paren change across
41×3 emissions is the miscompile line itself. The FruitCake gate now prints a **float-state checksum**
(NaN → loud -1) — integer-only stdout had masked the NaN by coincidence. `--out` now creates its dir.
CLI+NuGet → 0.1.1. New: `precedence_null_coalesce.pg` + `precedence_bitwise.pg` (42/42 C#/TS, 41/41 py).
**Hotfix 0.1.3 ✅ (2026-07-04) — C# nullable-reference annotations + `#nullable enable`** (PLAN §Hotfix
0.1.3; found live by the MintPlayer.AI FruitCake pilot): the csharp plugin's `type` rule kept the `?` only
on nullable **value** types (`i32?`→`int?`) and **dropped it on reference types** — `record Pair(a: Box,
b: Box?)` emitted `Box b`, a §3.C faithfulness break that cascades CS8625/CS8073/CS8602 under
`<Nullable>enable/>` and forces `#nullable disable` on every generated file (TS already emitted `Box |
null`). Fix (csharp plugin only, zero Core change): the two nullable `type` cases collapse to one (`base` +
`?`, correct for both value and reference types), and **every generated C# file now begins with `#nullable
enable`** (Program-scaffold rule data) so the annotations are valid regardless of the consumer's project
setting. All declaration positions render through the one `type` rule, so the fix covers record params,
fields, method params/returns and locals at once (verified). Also fixed the one genuinely-nullable warning
the header surfaced in universally-shipped code: `print<T>`'s `(object)x` → `(object?)x` (CS8600). A
full-corpus scan under `<Nullable>enable</>;<TreatWarningsAsErrors>true</>` proves the header adds **zero**
nullable warnings corpus-wide (39/41 clean; the other 2 are pre-existing, non-nullable — CS0168 an unused
`catch` binding and CS1718 the deliberate `v != v` NaN idiom in the fruitcake/precedence test programs).
New: `nullable_positions.pg` (C#/TS/Python agree `4`) + `tests/nullable/run-nullable.ps1` (annotations-
preserved + NRT-clean gate, wired into `build-and-test.ps1`). CLI + NuGet → 0.1.3, csharp plugin → 0.2.1.
**Roadmap: P10** (plugin *distribution* — now largely absorbed into P19 slices 10–12), **P11**
(build-integration NuGet — ✅ v1 above; per-RID CI + publish now scoped as P22), **P16d** (Visual Studio
LSP client), **P20** (input skins, gated, above), **P22 🚧 slices 1–2 + 4–5 built — cross-platform CLI
(Linux) + multi-RID distribution** (PRD §4.14, PLAN §P22, 4-agent investigation 2026-07-04; **macOS not
planned** — shipping set = Windows + Linux, osx design retained for reference): Core is already 100%
portable C++; done + verified on WSL Linux = CLI-only POSIX fixes + a parallel CMake build (VS-2026
`.vcxproj` untouched) + a Windows+Linux(x64/arm64) release matrix + the fat multi-RID NuGet (the `.targets`
was already RID-generic) — **the north star is proven: `dotnet build` transpiles `.pg` on Linux via the
NuGet**. Remaining: the PHP runtime differential (slice 3) + the esbuild-pattern npm sibling (slice 6);
release/nuget-push YAML is CI-only-verifiable (needs a dispatch run). **P21** (watch mode — ✅ done, above).

## Sibling repo
The P8 dogfood target (FruitCake physics twins) lives in `C:\Repos\MintPlayer.AI` — see PRD §8 for paths.
That repo is a .NET + Angular app; this one is unrelated C++ tooling. Don't run its build/tests from here.
